# SimpleScraper
SimpleScraper is a RESTful API designed to be a micro-service solution for trivial and straightforward web scraping/crawling tasks, in order to avoid coding your own scraper. Various endpoints support grabbing DOM elements by class or id, gathering all page links for crawling, and returning entire DOM content for text-mining etc. Developed using Spring Boot.
